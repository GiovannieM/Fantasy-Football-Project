# FantasyFootball_project
This project is for web scraping NFL player(s) for ML modeling and predictions.
The project was created as a challenge for myself to learn something new and grow my skills
and is currently seperated into 3 different programs due to the constant updates. It is
easier for me to have them seperated at the moment but will eventually be one whole program that works in unison.
## Installation Requirements
