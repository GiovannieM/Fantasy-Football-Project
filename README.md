# FantasyFootball_project
This project is for web scraping NFL player(s) for ML modeling and predictions.
The project was created as a challenge for myself to learn something new and grow my skills
and is currently seperated into 3 different programs due to the constant updates. It is
easier for me to have them seperated at the moment but will eventually be one whole program that works in unison.

These programs use multple modules to be able to work with the data which are listed below:
Web Scraping modules:
  [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
  [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/#module-pandas)
  [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)
Linear Regression modules:
  [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/#module-pandas)
  [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/)
  [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)
  [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html)
  For example of the Linear Rregression follow the link below.
